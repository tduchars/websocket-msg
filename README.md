## Small Messaging:

Decided to develop skills in a few areas which I have not used as much.

This small project uses:

-> Material.ui for styled components

-> Socket.io for real time messages between users.

-> Also uses React hooks to set context in the store to help seperate the topics for each 'chatroom' and seperate the different chats accordingly.
